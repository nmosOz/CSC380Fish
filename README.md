# CSC380Fish
This is the finished repository for Team Fish from the Fall 2023 CS380 class.

Most of the files in this repository are for the server side client to detect, identify, and create reports based on videos of fish, which are then displayed on a website. The other programs are for the Nuc to record and save videos to the server.
