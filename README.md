# Fish Movement Detection Program
This program was designed using OpenCV to be able to detect movement in Round Gobies and be able to correctly identify that any movement in the tank is a goby.

## Program Description
This program would automatically record videos using a simple webcam attached to an Intel NUC. The NUC would, every 30 minutes, send a video to a remote server for the Watchdog to be able to see and call the detect.py class to analyze the video.
